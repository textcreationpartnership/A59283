            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the firſt whereof, the Name and Nature of theſe Crimes, and of <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Improper Members</hi> of the Body, are unfolded: The Doctrine of <hi>Canonical Regularity</hi> and <hi>Irregularity,</hi> from which that Diſtinction in order to Crimes deſcends, explained: Alſo the Method of purſuing and defending in theſe Crimes; the Competency of the Judge; the Order of Probation; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Procedure of the Inqueſt, is ſet down.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond PART, The Puniſhments of theſe Crimes are handled; <hi>Retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> which is the firſt of them, diſtinguiſhed; and the Practice of that <hi>Species</hi> thereof called <hi>Pythagorical</hi> or <hi>Arithmetical,</hi> refuted; from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Divines and Lawyers; and even from the Opinion of the <hi>Rabbies:</hi> The other <hi>Species</hi> called <hi>Aristotelical, Analogical</hi> or <hi>Geometrical,</hi> reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to natural Equity, and to the Law of GOD. The Puniſhment of <hi>Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Hand,</hi> though in many Caſes practiſed, yet, rejected from being the ordinary Puniſhment of theſe Crimes. <hi>Arbitrary Puniſhments</hi> aſſerted in place of both; and a well regulated Arbitrary Power prov'd to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and neceſſary to Judges, for augmenting and diminiſhing Puniſhments, in theſe and in other Crimes, according to Circumſtances attending the committing of them. And in both Parts the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> of this and other Nations are compared.</p>

            <p>WHen I gave the firſt of the following Sheets to Mr. <hi>Andrew Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that he might publiſh them, 'twas my Deſire that my Name ſhould be conceal'd, to the end that the Reader (being leſt to his Conjectures about the Author) might aſcribe them to a perſon of greater Learning, whoſe Reputation in the World might add more Luſtre to the Work than my obſcure Name could do; But the Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by ſome miſtaken Apprehenſion having prefix'd my Name, has thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd me to premit the following Account beyond what the Introduction contains, which was all the Preface I at firſt deſign'd.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of my Writing was this; Mr. <hi>Symſon,</hi> Miniſter of the Goſpel, having in the year 1689. retir'd to this City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> reſolv'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtles advice<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.11.</note>

               <hi>have to give to him that needeth.</hi> And in proſecution of this virtuous Reſolution having taken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Trade, he well underſtood, of publiſhing and ſelling of Books, deſir'd from me and his other good Friends, to give him ſuch Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as might fall in our way.</p>
            <p>Some of the Honourable <hi>Society</hi> of Advocats, Mr. <hi>Symſons</hi> Patrons and Be nefactors, having advis'd him to publiſh a ſecond Edition of the <hi>Laws and Customs of Scotland in Matters Criminal,</hi> written by the Learned Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> of <hi>Roſehaugh;</hi> and he being deſirous that this ſecond Edition might go out with ſome Addition; I was prevail'd with, though unfit for the Undertaking, to write the following <hi>Appendix;</hi> and the Subject being leſt to my own choice, I pitched upon the Crimes of <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration,</hi> as theſe on which leaſt had been written, and yet afforded variety of Matter both profitable and pleaſant, whereof I hope the Reader will be convinced, after he has peruſed theſe following Papers.</p>
            <p>For Methods ſake, I have divided this little Work in two Parts; In the firſt whereof (containing Matter <hi>Medico-legal</hi>) I have ſpoken of the Names and Nature of theſe Crimes, and ſhewen they can only be committed on <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Members</hi> of the <hi>Body;</hi> and from thence I have taken occaſion to deſcribe both <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>improper Members,</hi> and to ſhow how far the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, aroſe from the Doctrine of <hi>Canonical Regularity</hi> and <hi>Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> I have likewiſe ſet down ſome general Directions for forming a Lybel, with the moſt remarkable Defences; and ſome Obſervations anent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of the Judge; the Method of Probation; the Inqueſts their Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; intermixing now and then, with Citations of Law, ſome pertinent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Hiſtory, to divert the Reader.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Part I have conſidered the Puniſhments of thoſe Crimes; and have handled <hi>Retaliation</hi> (which is the firſt of them) as a matter <hi>Hiſtorico-theologico-juridical;</hi> and refuted the <hi>Species</hi> thereof, called <hi>Pythagorical</hi> or <hi>Arithmetical;</hi> and reconcil'd the other <hi>Species,</hi> called <hi>Ariſtotelical, Analogical,</hi> or <hi>Geometrical,</hi> to Natural Equity, and to the Law of GOD. And that for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Debate in the Books of Adjournal about <hi>ſtrict Retaliation.</hi> I have alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the Puniſhment of <hi>Amputation</hi> of a Hand, and rejected it from being the ordinary puniſhment of thoſe Crimes, and have aſſerted <hi>Arbitrary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58259:3"/>to be the <hi>Ordinary;</hi> and deſcribed <hi>Arbitrary puniſhment</hi> in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſhowen how far a well regulated <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> is uſeful and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in Judges; for ſatisfaction of ſome who are ſcandalized at the very Name of every thing call'd <hi>Arbitrary;</hi> and laſt of all, I have endeavoured to clear the Senſe of the ancient Statute of King <hi>Robert</hi> the Second, which declares the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of the <hi>Mutilator</hi> to be in the Kings Will. All which is more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held forth in the <hi>Summaries</hi> pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ixt to each Part, which, according to the Method of <hi>Farinacius,</hi> contain au Abridgment of the Heads they relate to.</p>
            <p>In the performance of this Task, I have adduced the Teſtimonies of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, Divines</hi> and other Authors, as the Subject of each of theſe Parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and have compar'd them with the Citations of <hi>Civil Law,</hi> and <hi>D D.</hi> and Deciſions, in the Books of Adjournal, and have diſpos'd them in ſuch a Method as makes the Work altogether new, and yet no part of the <hi>Criminal Law</hi> needed more to be known, becauſe the Crimes I treat of, have frequently occurr'd, and muſt occur ſo long as the Wickedneſs of Man prompts him to Revenge.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premitted concerning the Occaſion and the Matter of the <hi>Appendix,</hi> I crave leave by way of <hi>Apology</hi> to repreſent; firſt, That when I enter'd upon this Task, I deſign'd to comprehend all I had to ſay, in ſix or ſeven Sheets; but one Thought following upon another, ſwell'd them to the Number they now appear in. Next, during all the time I was employed about theſe Sheets, I met with frequent Interruptions from a long and tedious <hi>Sute of Law,</hi> ſufficiently known to be juſt on my part, where through I was obliged to give in every Sheet, as it was finiſhed, to the Preſs, before I had time to digeſt another, to ſatisfy the Importunity of the Printers who frequently called for them: and this did ſo haſten and drive me, that I was forced to take Hours from my Sleep to Reviſe and Correct the Sheets. This <hi>Precipitation</hi> occaſion'd ſome Literal Miſtakes, and if even Errors in Matter ſhould appear, (as I hope they will not) I may be allowed to excuſe my ſelf in theſe words of the Judicious <hi>Noodt.</hi>

                  <p>This Subject is handled in the Title of <hi>Injuries,</hi>

But, this Controverſie being of no moment, the Reader may append this ſmall Treatiſe either to the Title of <hi>Murder</hi> or of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,</hi> as he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>I have divided this little Tractat in two Parts; In the firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I conſider the Nature of theſe Crimes or Delicts, together with the Method of purſuing and defending in them. In the ſecond, I conſider their Pains and Puniſhments. The Matter of the firſt Part is, <hi>medico-juridical;</hi> and, for this cauſe the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and Lawyers have been mutually aſſiſting to each other. And the caſes reſolved by them, are called, <hi>Quaestiones medico-legales.</hi> This Subject is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be known; and the wickedneſs and vindictive Nature of Mankind, has made the knowledge thereof neceſſary. As its uſeful ſo its difficult, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be ſo, by <hi>For tunatus Fidelis,</hi> a learned Phyſician, who having writen a Book <hi>in Octavo, de Relationibus Medicorum,</hi> in which (for clearing the eaſes wherein Judges are in uſe to call for the Advice of Phyſicians) he <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>tit.</hi> 5. <hi>de Mutilatione,</hi> introduces his Diſcourſe with theſe words: <hi>Hand parva difficultas quibuſiam medicis interdum offertur, ſi quando a judice de mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis eſt referendum; ſi io enim mulios eſse que cum ſcientiarum titulo ſe vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, quid tamen ipſa ſit mutilatio plunè ignorant.</hi> And the Diſſiculty appears in the different Sentiments about it. The ſecond Part is <hi>Theologico juridical,</hi> and hath many thorny Queſtions in it, eſpecially about the pain of <hi>Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which hath perplexed both Divines and Lawyers, and yet few have written on theſe two Delicts, as Delicts deſerving puniſhment. It's true the <hi>Canouiſts</hi> have conſidered them as they are the Cauſes of Canonical irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and many of the <hi>Civilians</hi> alſo have conſidered them as to that end; but they ſay little of them as they are puniſhable Crimes, which has induced me to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58259:7"/>make this ſmall Eſſay, hoping it may encourage others to do better; and if they diſcover any Miſtakes, as perhaps they may, they'll do me a favour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them.</p>
                  <p>For underſtanding the different Expreſſions of the DD.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it's neceſſary to premit, that the words <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration,</hi> are variouſly taken by Divines and Lawyers, as alſo by Phyſicians (whom Lawyers uſe to conſult in ſuch Matters.) By <hi>Mutilation</hi> we commonly underſtand the Ceſſation and Privation of the Office, and diſtinct Operation of a Member, albeit no Particle of it be cut off: And by <hi>Demembration,</hi> we underſtand the cutting off of a Member, and in this ſenſe we find theſe words uſed in the Journal Books. But <hi>Fortunat. Fidel. dict. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ſect.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. makes uſe of the word <hi>Debile,</hi> to ſignifie that which we call a <hi>mutilated Member,</hi> and of the words <hi>mutilum, mutilatum, curtum, decurtatum, deſciſſum vel detruncatum;</hi> and of the Greek word <hi>Colobon,</hi> as Synonymous words, to ſignifie a Member wanting an extreme part; and cites the words of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 5. <hi>Metaph. cap.</hi> 27. <hi>Mutila ſunt, non cujuſve particulae privatione, nam ſi carnem aut ſplenem tollas, non propterea mutilus remanebit, ſed ſi extremitatem, at<expan>

                  <p>I find the word <hi>Mutilation</hi> in King <hi>Roberts</hi> ſaid Statute; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it's there taken for <hi>Demembration;</hi> for it's there ſaid, <hi>If any man</hi> mutilats <hi>another, or wounds or hurts him be forethought fellony, and the Party grieved purſue him before a Judge, ſuch Form and Order of Proceſs ſhall be led againſt him, as is ordained againſt a Man-ſlayer.</hi> Now either the word <hi>Mutilation</hi> muſt ſignifie <hi>Demembration,</hi> or it will follow, that <hi>Demembration</hi> is not in the Statute; and that <hi>Mutilation</hi> which is leſs than <hi>Demembration,</hi> is puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable as <hi>Homicide:</hi> For the following words of the Statute, ordain the <hi>Mutilator</hi> to be tryed by an Aſſyze, and if he be convicted, his Life to be redeemable; which ſhews that his Life, for committing that Crime, is in the Kings Will. And therefore for correcting this Miſtake, the Act 28. <hi>Parl.</hi> 3. <hi>Ja.</hi> 4. conjoyns <hi>Slaughter</hi> and <hi>Demembration,</hi> without mention of <hi>Mutila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In our later Cuſtom of Speaking, and in all the Journal Books extant,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58259:7"/>
                     <hi>Mutilation</hi> ſignifies only the taking away the uſe of a Member, the Member ſtill remaining with the Body: and ſo is a leſs Crime than <hi>Demembration,</hi> which (according to the notation of the word) ſignifies Obtruncation, or a ſeparating a Member from the Body; and ſome DD. do ſo underſtand and diſtinguiſh them.</p>
                  <p>It's further to be remarked, that <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> properly taken, are Names of Crimes, or if you pleaſe of Delicts, and ſo they are to be underſtood in theſe Laws and Acts of Parliament; and therefore it is, that in <hi>Act</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 16. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. the Crime of <hi>Mutilation</hi> is expreſſed by that word in the Narrative of the Act; whereas the word <hi>Amputation</hi> is made uſe of in the Statutory Part, to expreſs the Puniſhment of cutting off a Hand; and in like manner the words <hi>abſcindere &amp; amputare,</hi> are made uſe of to that end, <hi>in l.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Auth. ſeq. c. de ſerv. fugit. &amp; novel</hi> 134. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mutilation</hi> then, as it's the name of a Delict, may be deſcribed to be,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
                     <hi>A voluntary Act of privat Violence, by which one hurts a Member of anothers Body, to that degree, that the Member ceaſeth to be uſeful.</hi> And this is commonly done by cutting the Nerves and Sinews by which the Member is moved. <hi>Demembrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a further degree of this Violence, by which a Member is cut off and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Body.</hi> And <hi>Debilitation</hi> is betwixt the two, and ſignifies with us, the weakning of a Member without taking away it's total uſe.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> to be the apprehending of the Object. So that now it's eaſie to reſolve what it is to <hi>mutilate</hi> a proper Member. <hi>viz.</hi> nothing elſe but to make it uncapable of moving to, and apprehending of the Object.</p>
                  <p>But then ſome object and ſay, that if it be neceſſary to the Eſſence of <hi>Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> that the Member be ſo totally diſabled, that it's for no more uſe to the Body; it's all one upon the matter to Mutilat and Demember, and ſo <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration,</hi> which we define as diſtinct Crimes, are confounded. This Objection is moved by <hi>Suarez. dict. diſp.</hi> 44: § 2. <hi>N:</hi> 5. where he diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes and defines theſe two Crimes, as we do, from the Authority of <hi>Panormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in Clement. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nic. de homicid.</hi> and yet anſwers to the Objection; that ſuppoſe the Fault were equal, yet the Effect is not ſimply the ſame, which is ſufficient for not extending the puniſhment. Next, he ſays, the Damnage in both is not equal, becauſe the Deformity is not equal. Moreover a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Hand has ſtill the name of a Hand, and of a Member ſo long as it's affixed to the Body; as we ſhall ſhew when we come to ſpeak of the Hand in particular.</p>
                  <p>The next thing, that falls in my way,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> is to ſpeak of each particular part of the Body ſeparatly, and to ſhew which of them falls under the Definition of a <hi>proper Member,</hi> and which not: And becauſe we have much Light from the Canoniſts in this Point (who deſcribe the Nature of Members; and of <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration</hi> committed upon them, in order to clear the Nature of Canonical Regularity and Irregularity) I crave leave to digreſs a little upon this Subject, and to ſhew how it's concerned with the Crimes of <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration.</hi>

                  <p>To be irregular then,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> in a canonical Senſe, is to be entered in one of the Religious Orders of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and to be ſubject to the Rules of the Order, whence is the Denomination of <hi>Regular;</hi> and Irregularity is to be under a Canonical Impediment, that hinders to enter into the Order, or to remain in it, if entered. <hi>Covarru. init. relect. de Homicid.

                  <p>Secondly, It will be convenient that in a <hi>Libel</hi> of <hi>Mutilation, ex: gr.</hi> of the <hi>Eye,</hi> the true matter of Fact by which the Sight was taken away be condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on, and ſo in the foreſaid Action 28. <hi>July</hi> 1643. <hi>Logie</hi> againſt <hi>Howiſon,</hi> the <hi>Libel</hi> bears, that the <hi>Eye</hi> was mutilated by a Stroke with a Tree on the Head; which brought a Defluction on the <hi>Eye,</hi> and occaſioned a <hi>Blindneſs.</hi> If the <hi>Libel</hi> be ſo formed, it will the better quadrat with the <hi>Probation.</hi> and prevent all Cavillation, which may occur by reaſon of Difference that may happen between the Tenor of the <hi>Libel</hi> and <hi>Probation.</hi> I ſay it will prevent Cavillation; but I ſay not, that a <hi>Libel</hi> without this Condeſcendence will be rejected as irrelevant; for the contrary was found. 19 <hi>Nov.</hi> 1647, <hi>Inglis</hi> of <hi>Craigmakerren</hi> againſt <hi>Martin;</hi> where the <hi>Juſtices</hi> ſound a <hi>Libel</hi> of <hi>Mutilation</hi> relevant without ſuch a condeſcendence, notwithſtanding it was urg'd that <hi>Mutilation</hi> falls no otherwiſe under the external ſenſe, but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Inciſions or other Hurts from which it's inferred. But there will be greater difficulty in a Libel of <hi>Demembration, ex. gr.</hi> of a <hi>Leg;</hi> which was not cut off by the ſtroke or wound, but was cruſhed to that Degree, that the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> was neceſſitated to cut it off; for if the true matter of Fact be not libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but, in place thereof, it be ſaid, that the Pannel cut off the Leg; then the Pannel will ſimply deny the <hi>Lybel,</hi> and conſent it be found relevant, <hi>as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;</hi> and then when the Witneſſes come to be examined, a Debate will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe upon the Interrogatories, for either they muſt be agreeable to the <hi>Lybel,</hi> or to the <hi>Matter of Fact:</hi> If to the <hi>Lybel, viz.</hi> whither they knew, that the Pannel cut off the <hi>Leg?</hi> they will depone <hi>negative;</hi> and if to the <hi>Matter of Fact, viz.</hi> if the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> cut it off, then it will be objected, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories are diſconforme to the Lybel; and ought to be rejected; becauſe the <hi>Lybel</hi> is found relevant <hi>as conceived;</hi> bearing that the <hi>Pannel</hi> cut off the <hi>Leg;</hi> whereas if the true Matter of Fact had been lybelled, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon</hi> cut it off; the Pannel would have alledg'd and prov'd, that the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> did it <hi>ex malo regimine:</hi> Of which Defence he had no uſe as the Lybel was conceived: and ſo the Pannel being by the <hi>Conception</hi> of the <hi>Lybel</hi> depriv'd of that <hi>Defence,</hi> the Witneſſes can only be examined upon the preciſe terms of the Lybel. And ſuppoſe the <hi>Juſtices</hi> do ſuſtain the Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories as they agree to the <hi>matter of Fact, viz.</hi> that the <hi>Pannel</hi> cruſhed the <hi>Leg</hi> and the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> cut it off, yet it may be after much Altercation, which may be preveen'd by lybelling the true matter of Fact.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:58259:16"/>
                  <p>Thirdly; It will not be improper in a <hi>Lybel</hi> of <hi>Mutilation,</hi> to ſay, that the <hi>Member</hi> was not only rendered uſeleſs at the time by the Hurt it receav'd, but that it remains ſtill uſeleſs, never having recover'd: juſt as in a Lybel <hi>of Reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of a <hi>Bond</hi> or other deed granted on death bed, its uſual to ſay, that the Defunct dyed of the Sickneſs and never went to <hi>Kirk</hi> or <hi>Mercat</hi> after he granted the <hi>Bond;</hi> for by this negative (which proves it ſelf) the burden of proving the Contrary, (<hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Member</hi> did recover its ſtrength) is devolved on the Pannel.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If either <hi>Mutilation</hi> or <hi>Demembration</hi> be ſo ſecretly committed that no Witneſs ſaw it, and the Probation be only by <hi>Preſumptions,</hi> it will be very convenient to condeſcend upon the <hi>Preſumptions,</hi> in the Lybel, that the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may give <hi>Interloquitor</hi> upon the Relevancie of them, and leave nothing to the Aſſize but to cognoſce upon the Fact of thoſe <hi>Preſumptions,</hi> becauſe it is hard in many caſes to judge upon the relevancy of <hi>Preſumptions.</hi> This Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was practiſed in the Lybel of <hi>Demembration</hi> at the inſtance of the Relict &amp; Children of <hi>William Fenton</hi> againſt <hi>Montgomery,</hi> upon which the <hi>Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Justiciary</hi> gave their <hi>Interloquitor,</hi> dated 19. <hi>March</hi> 1690. find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Preſumptions</hi> relevant to infer an arbitrary <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> and remitted the ſame [<hi>id eſt,</hi> the matter of Fact of the <hi>Preſumptions</hi>] to the Knowledge of an Aſſize, whereas if the <hi>Preſumptions</hi> had not been lybelled, but had been firſt adduced before the Aſſize, it's a thouſand to one if they had not given a <hi>Verdict,</hi> finding the Lybel not proved, becauſe it concluded pain of death, on the account that the breaking of <hi>Fentons</hi> Leg was the cauſe of his death; which the <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> would not depone. I find a Libel of <hi>Homicid,</hi> 12. <hi>April.</hi> 1637. had been formed after the ſame manner; at the inſtance of the <hi>Kings Advocat</hi> againſt <hi>Memath,</hi> for murdering a poor Chapman upon the Hill of <hi>Corſtorphine</hi> where no witneſſes were preſent and no other probation but preſumptive.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, there are ſome, both <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> who think it convenient in a Lybel of atrocious <hi>Demembration</hi> to conclude that the puniſhment of <hi>Retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> may be corporaly inflicted on the Pannel, (as was done in the foreſaid Purſuit, <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Leſlie</hi> againſt <hi>Pitfoddels</hi>) to this end, that if either the Pannel be <hi>ſolvent,</hi> yet unwilling to pay what the Judge ſhall think fit to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie by way of Aſſythment: Or if he be <hi>vilis perſona,</hi> or <hi>indigent:</hi> corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment may be inflicted; In which laſt caſe the Lawyers ſay that <hi>Paupertas facit poenam pecuniariam commutari in perſonalem.

                  <p>I come now to the <hi>Defences;</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> ſome whereof are <hi>Dilatory</hi> and ſerve only to continue or delay the Dyet; others are <hi>peremptory</hi> which elide the Lybel. Of the firſt kind are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="71"/> It's a good Defence againſt a Lybel of <hi>Mutilation</hi> that year and day is not elapſ'd, ſince the Time lybelled of committing the Crime, this the Juſtices will ſuſtain and continue the Dyet till Year and Day elapſe, becauſe by our Cuſtom, as aforeſaid, ſo much time is allowed to expect recovery. So they found 17. <hi>Decem.</hi> 1624. <hi>Boyne</hi> againſt <hi>Hately</hi> and 10. <hi>January</hi> 1640. <hi>Ker</hi> againſt <hi>Halyburton</hi> and <hi>Crawmond.</hi> It was alſo propon'd 9. and 11. <hi>January</hi> 1628. <hi>Mcmurran</hi> againſt <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and in the above-cited 3. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1647. <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Leſly</hi> againſt <hi>Pitfoddels;</hi> but none of theſe two came to a Deciſion. The reply to this (if the Day of Committing be condeſcended on) is; that though the Lybel be raiſed within year and day, yet it's not inſiſted on, till year and day be elapſed; or in caſe a certain day be lybelled with an Alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive [of one other of the days of that Moneth or Moneths of the year] then the Reply is, that ſuppoſe count be made from the laſt day of that year, it will be found to be expired.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:58259:16"/>
                  <p>This <hi>Defence,</hi> that year and day is not elapſed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="72"/> takes no place againſt a Lybel of <hi>Demembration;</hi> becauſe where a <hi>Member</hi> is cut off, recovery is not to be expected, as was found, 27. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1618. <hi>Thomſon</hi> againſt <hi>Miln,</hi> for biteing off her Finger.</p>
                  <p>If the Purſuit be both for <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="73"/> 
                     <hi>ex. gra.</hi> for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilating two Fingers, and demembring the Hand of other two: the Purſuer may paſs from the <hi>Mutilation,</hi> and inſiſt within year and day for the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membration;</hi> as was found in the foreſaid caſe 17. <hi>Decem.</hi> 1622. <hi>Boyne</hi> againſt <hi>Hately,</hi> for demembering him of two Fingers and mutilating him of other two.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>Dilatory</hi> Defence is, that the Caſe is <hi>ſubmitted:</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="74"/> and the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquitor</hi> in ſuch a Debate is, to continue the Dyet, till the day of the Expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Submiſſion;</hi> which may be either condeſcended on, and inſert in the Act of Continuation; or the Juſtices may put the Pannel under <hi>Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to anſwer on fifteen days warning, in caſe the <hi>Submiſſion</hi> take no effect; 14. <hi>June</hi> 1626. <hi>Ord</hi> againſt <hi>Forbes;</hi> 15. <hi>June</hi> 1629. <hi>Paterſon</hi> againſt <hi>Wordie;</hi> and 20. <hi>July</hi> 1627. <hi>inter eoſdem:</hi> From theſe two <hi>dilatory,</hi> two <hi>peremptory</hi> Defences follow.</p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>peremptory</hi> Defence is, that the mutilated <hi>Member</hi> is perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verad; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="75"/> in ſo far as the Purſuer makes uſe thereof as he did formerly: and it will be fit to condeſcend upon the Deeds of Stength, which are the Evidences of <hi>Recovery. Ex. gra.</hi> againſt a Lybel of mutilating of the Hand of the Fingers, it was found relevant that the Purſuer had ridden up and down the Countrey, &amp; held the Bridle with that Hand and Fingers; and that he cut up Poultrie and Geeſe at the Table, as he had been in uſe to do; 15. <hi>Dec.</hi> 1630. <hi>Barclay</hi> againſt <hi>Kennedy</hi> in <hi>Mayboll,</hi> where the <hi>Defence</hi> being prov'd, the Aſſize cleanſ'd the Pannel; and the Juſtices only fin'd him in an hundred <hi>Merks</hi> of Expenſes for the Cure The like <hi>Defence</hi> was ſuſtained in the foreſaid Purſuit of <hi>Mutila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 3. <hi>Novem.</hi> 1621. <hi>Williamſon</hi> againſt <hi>Marion Paton</hi> reſidenter in <hi>Leith,</hi> for diſlocating the <hi>Spondyls</hi> of his Back, and mutilating him of his Leg; in which Purſuit the Juſtices found this <hi>Defence</hi> relevant to elide the Lybel, that the Purſuer, being a young Boy, had in his uſual Recreations with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauds, run Races on the <hi>Links</hi> of <hi>Leith;</hi> as he was in uſe to do before he was hurt. As alſo 6. <hi>June</hi> 1627. <hi>Leſly</hi> againſt <hi>Harvie,</hi> for breaking, at leaſt lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mutilating him of his left Leg; this Alledgiance was found relevant, that the Purſuer had walked from his Houſe many Miles.</p>
                  <p>This Defence of <hi>Recovery,</hi> is only relevant againſt a Lybel for <hi>Mutilation;</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="76"/> for, as hath been ſaid, Members once preſcinded cannot be recovered; But <hi>Gaſpar Taliacotius,</hi> in his <hi>Chirurgia nova de Narium, Aurium, Labiorumque de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu,</hi> pretends to have diſcovered a new Art of repairing Noſes <hi>per inciſionem cutis ex humero.</hi> And <hi>Lanfrancus</hi> cited by P. <hi>Zacchias quaeſt. medico-leg. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>tit.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 3. <hi>N.</hi> 3. reports, that ſome had aſſerted that a Noſe, which once lay preſcinded in the owners hand, was thereafter reſtored to it's place; but he calls it an impudent Falſhood.

                  <p>The ſecond <hi>peremptory</hi> Defence is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="77"/> that the caſe being ſubmitted, the Arbiters have decerned, and the Pannel is willing to ſulfill the <hi>Decreet,</hi> or has already done it and obtained a <hi>Diſcharge;</hi> or that the Parties have <hi>tranſacted</hi> and agreed; this I ſay is relevant; for all Injuries become extinct by <hi>Paction</hi> or <hi>Tranſaction l. ſitibi:</hi> 17: §: 1: <hi>l: ſi unus</hi> 27: §. <hi>pacta</hi> 4.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Juſtices do oftentimes recommend to the Parties to ſubmit,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="78"/> ſo they did-in the foreſaid caſe 15. <hi>July</hi> 1642. <hi>Cheyne</hi> of <hi>Wallie</hi> and his Brother againſt <hi>Monat</hi> and <hi>Neivings,</hi> where Sir <hi>William Dick</hi> Stewart of <hi>Orkney</hi> compearing to repledge, the Juſtices recommended to him to agree the parties. Sometimes a judicial Submiſſion is made to the Lords themſelves, as was done 1. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1650. by <hi>Mclure</hi> and <hi>Baxters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence obſerve that the Crime of <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration</hi> are but <hi>privata delicta;</hi>

                  <p>A third peremptory Defence is, that the King has remitted the Crime, &amp; ordered an Aſſythment; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="80"/> &amp; the Pannel has found, or is willing to find Caution to pay the ſame as ſhall be modified; or that its already modified &amp; conſign'd: which Defence, as its uſual againſt <hi>Homicide,</hi> ſo, is expreſly ſuſtained to fiſt the Purſuit of <hi>Demembration</hi> 17. <hi>May</hi> 1610. <hi>Rob.

                     <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> (which is a tacit Diſcharge inferred from a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſe and Acts of Kindneſs) is a good <hi>peremptory Defence.</hi> §. <hi>ult.

But abſtracting from theſe or the like Circumſtances, friendly converſing &amp; drinking together, is aſtrong Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of paſſing from the Crime, according to <hi>Mathaeus; Apud Germanos</hi> (ſays he <hi>dict. tit.</hi> N. 14.) <hi>propinatio poculi validiſſimum diſſimulatae injuriae argumentum est.</hi>

                     <hi>res judicata</hi> is an uncontroverted Defen ce; the Tryal being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Justices</hi> who are the Judges competent: But (as I ſaid before, <hi>N.</hi> 67.) neither is the <hi>Privy Council</hi> nor any <hi>Barron-Court</hi> Judge competent. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 16. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. And therefore their Decreets will not ſerve for an <hi>Abſolvitor;</hi> but if the Purſuer paſſes from the <hi>Mutilation,</hi> and inſiſts for Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Wounding only; <hi>res judicata</hi> before the Privy Council or an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Court, is ſufficient; and if it be the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Decreet, and a Reduction of it raiſed, and a Reply upon the Reduction; the Juſtices will continue the Proceſs for a time, till the event of the Reduction be known.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="83"/> It's a good <hi>Defence</hi> that the Privy Council hath precognoſced, found the <hi>Pannel</hi> innocent, and diſcharged the Juſtiees to proceed.

I come next in this ſecond Part to ſpeak of <hi>Puniſhments</hi> and <hi>Damnages;</hi> which are not always the ſame, but vary, in theſe as in other Crimes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Circumſtances; <hi>tot. tit. ff. de poenis.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Retaliation;</hi> which is the firſt of theſe, is a Puniſhment of equal Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the doing to one as he hath done to his Neighbour; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="100"/> inſtituted by GOD; committed to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Magiſtrat for Execution; and thereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved by the <hi>Gentile Nations,</hi> upon the account of it's natural equity, and executed by the Rule of Geometrical Proportion. All which I ſhall make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſeveral Concluſions.

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="115"/> From the practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who may be admitted to clear the ſenſe of a Political Law of their State, becauſe they were the firſt Receivers of it; and they neither did, nor in all caſes of Bodily Injuries could, obſerve any other but <hi>Geometrical Proportion;</hi> For, as it appears by the Particulars following,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="116"/> In many Caſes it was impoſſible to take <hi>Retaliation;</hi> as in the Example, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.22. of a Woman who by a Hurt given to her by mens ſtriving toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, makes an Abortion, or parts with an inanimat Child; the man could not be puniſhed by a <hi>Pythagorical Retaliation,</hi> but a Sum of Money ſucceeded in place of Puniſhment, by the words of the Text. In like manner, there could not be a <hi>Pythagorical Retaliation</hi> in Injuries done to the Body by Rapes and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; and therefore when <hi>Sampſons</hi> Father in Law, with concourſe of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> took his Wife from him and gave her to his Companion: <hi>Sampſon</hi> did not take their Wives and beſtow them upon others, according to the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe of the Law of <hi>Retaliation;</hi> but he, as a Judge and Ruler in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> having power to take Revenge for Injuries done to the Perſon and Honour of his Wife, compenſed them by burning of their Corn, with their Vineyards and Olives, <hi>&amp;c. Judg.</hi> 15.5. Yet nevertheleſs, he excuſes his taking revenge, in words declaring it to be <hi>Retaliation,</hi> ſaying, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>AS they did into me, SO have I done unto them.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="117"/> The Law of <hi>Retaliation</hi> did not hinder the Jews to <hi>tranſact</hi> for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done to their Perſons except Death was the Conſequence of the Injury, and this is inferred from Gods prohibiting Tranſactions ſimply in the caſe of <hi>Homicide, Numb.</hi> 33.31. <hi>ye ſhall take no ranſom for the life of a Murderer:</hi> So <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.25. infers. [<hi>Joſephus Antiqu. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 46. gives the Flection to the Purſuer whither he will have the Fine or the reciprocal Puniſhment: but <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> a man well verſed in Rabbinical learning, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no ſuch thing out of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> whom he adduces to prove their cuſtom of tranſacting.] And this ſerves to vindicat the practice of the Juſtice Court, where ſuch tranſactions are judicially allowed, as we ſhew among the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, <hi>N.</hi> 74.77.78, 79. <hi>ſupra.</hi> which prove that theſe kind of Injuries are but <hi>privata delicta,</hi> wherein the Publick is not concerned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="118"/> For the ſame Reaſon, (<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Paction</hi> or <hi>Tranſaction</hi> was allowed to the <hi>Jews, tanquam in delictis privatis</hi>) their Judges never did, nor were they obliged to enquire in theſe Crimes. And this is inferred from <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.17, 18. where it's ſaid, <hi>That both the men between whom the controverſie is ſhall ſtand before the Lord, before the Prieſts and the Judges which ſhall be in theſe days;</hi> and then, but not till then, its ſaid, <hi>the Judges ſhall make diligent inquiſition.</hi> This is another of <hi>Ainſworths</hi> Obſervations; and it agrees with the Civil Law, and our practice mentioned, <hi>dict.

                  <p n="4">4.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="119"/> If the Party injured did apply to the Judge, and inſiſted to have the Pain of <hi>Retaliation</hi> inflicted, yet even in that Caſe the Judge was not always oblig'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58259:26"/>to inflict it according to the words of the Law, but was to enquire into the circumſtances of time, perſons, place, age of the Delinquent, as alſo his ſtrength to undergo the Puniſhment, without the loſs of his Life; for a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, by the loſs of his Hand, might loſe his Life; likewiſe, the taking away the Eye of a <hi>Monoculus,</hi> or the Hand of a Delinquent, who had but one, would be harder to him, than what he had done to one having two Eyes or two Hands; the Judge was alſo to conſider, whether he was purſuing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending when the Crime was committed; and according to theſe and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he was to puniſh or not puniſh, &amp; to highten or leſſen the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he ſhould think fit, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> though the Rule of <hi>Retaliation</hi> foreſaid in <hi>Hurts,</hi> be only ſimple <hi>Retaliation; Stripe</hi> for <hi>Stripe,</hi> yet the ſingle ſmiting of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother was puniſhed with Death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.15.

                        <item>1. As the <hi>Rabbies</hi> acknowledge N. 117. <hi>ſupra,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> might <hi>Tranſact;</hi>

                        <item>3. It appears by <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>de oſſe fuſo vel dentibus excuſſis</hi> that the Law of GOD.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="125"/> 
                           <hi>Tooth for Tooth,</hi> was not followed in the <hi>Literal</hi> and <hi>Pythagorical</hi> Senſe, nor
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58259:28"/>could the Judge decern it in that Senſe, becauſe the Law limits him <hi>ad paenam CCC. aſſium;</hi> if the Party injured was a <hi>free man,</hi> and to the half it, if he were a <hi>Slave,</hi> and this difference ſhows, that the difference of perſons was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</item>

Moreover, if both parties ſhould haply be in the wrong, and multiply Injuries to one another, and thoſe of a different nature; it would be an unaccountable cruelty to raiſe a Suit for obtaining all theſe things to be done by way of</hi> Satisfaction <hi>and</hi> Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>for ſo, infinite</hi> Reciprocations <hi>and</hi> Retaliations <hi>would follow to both parties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe Arguments <hi>S. Caecilius</hi> makes anſwer (my dear <hi>Phavorinus</hi> ſays he) <hi>although one Member cannot be broken or bruiſed to the exact dimenſions of the wound and bruiſe of another,</hi>

                     <hi>yet</hi> Retaliation <hi>ſhould not therefore ſeem unjust; for why? we ſhould not require the ſame meaſure or nice ballancing, of the ſtroke upon the ſame Member, with reſpect to all circumſtances and accidents, for that cannot be done; but we ſhould rather conſider the intention of the</hi> Percuſſors

                     <hi>mind, and if he acted of deſign, or by ſudden paſſion; and ſeing the Law permits Tranſaction to be made, and a Ranſom to be payed, if in that caſe the</hi> Percuſſor <hi>will not redeem the Puniſhment, by payment of the Ranſom, the</hi> Decemviri, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Law, allowed</hi> Retaliation <hi>to be exacted, whether the</hi> Delinquency <hi>was done by</hi> deſign, <hi>or by</hi> inadvertency; <hi>for what Cruelty, I pray you, can there be, if the ſame be done to you which you did to another, eſpecially when you were allowed to tranſact and pay a Ranſom, and no neceſſity lay upon you to undergo</hi> Retaliation, <hi>unleſs you your ſelf had choos'd the ſame?

                  <p>And now ſeing <hi>Phavorinus,</hi>

But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the Diſpute betwixt theſe two <hi>Romans,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="131"/> ſhews what was the Opinion of that People at that time, even ſo the Arguments which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> urg'd long before againſt <hi>Pythagorical Retaliation,</hi> ſhew that the learned <hi>Athenians</hi> (from whom the <hi>Romans</hi> receiv'd that Law) had always underſtood, &amp; maintain'd it, according to the Rules of <hi>Diſtributive Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>Analogical</hi> Proportion. <q>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive Juſtice, <hi>ſays he,</hi> requires of Judges that they ſeriouſly conſider the Circumſtances of Fact, the Perſons by whom and againſt whom the Crimes are committed. For if a Peaſant ſhould beat a Magiſtrat, or a Child his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or a Slave his Patron, certainly the Crime would deſerve greater Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment than if committed by the Magiſtrat againſt the Peaſant, the Parent againſt the Child, or by the Patron againſt his Slave: and yet according to the Law of <hi>Pythagorical Retaliation,</hi> he muſt be equally puniſhed who offers a Blow to a Prince, and to a Begger: And a Slave offering Violence to his Patron, and a Patron injuring his Slave, muſt ſuffer the ſame degree of Puniſhment; which to every man ſeems abſurd: And on the ſame ground, if ye ſmite out the Eye of a <hi>Monoculus,</hi> you ſhall loſe but one Eye by way of Puniſhment, whereas if the <hi>Monoculus</hi> ſmite out your Eye, he muſt be made Blind, tho' he made not you Blind: and if you having two hands, ſmite off the ſingle Hand of your Neighbour, and thereby make him inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſerve himſelf in the neceſſities of Nature, yet you ſhall loſe but one Hand, and be ſtill capable to ſerve your ſelf with the other. Again, <hi>Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive Juſtice,</hi> as it conſiders the perſon, ſo it diligently ponders Time and Place, and one and the ſame Crime, is not equally atrocious at all Times, and in all Places, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> fancied, but increaſeth and diminiſheth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Time and Place of committing. Whereas if <hi>Pythagorical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation</hi> hold good, then he who Wounds his Neighbour in preſence of the Judge, and he who Wounds him in an obſcure Vault, and he who Wounds him in a Church, or Palace of the Prince, and he who Wounds him in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern or a Brothel houſe; muſt ſuffer alike Puniſhment. Moreover, if <hi>ſtrict Retaliation</hi> take place, then if <hi>Claudius Pompeius</hi> commit Adultery with <hi>Caeſars</hi> Queen, <hi>Caeſar</hi> may retaliat by committing Adultery with the Wife of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58259:29"/>
                        <hi>Claudius,</hi> which is contrary to the rules of Morality; and if <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſteal 1000 weight of Gold from the Theſaury of the People, they may retaliat by robbing the Coffers of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and if <hi>Albinus</hi> reproach <hi>Modius, Modius</hi> may in <hi>Retaliation</hi> revile <hi>Albinus,</hi> which were to be guilty of a ſinful ſort of <hi>Retaliation,</hi> and may take place according to <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Doctrine, not only in Adultery, Theft, and Reviling; but in Witchcraft, Sacriledge, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, violation of Sepulchres, Calumniation, Prevarication, ſuppoſititious Births, and all manner of Villanies; whereas all theſe Inconveniencies may be ſhun'd,</q> by obſerving the rules of <hi>Diſtributive Justice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now having given an account of theſe Debates,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="132"/> to prove matter of Fact, to wit, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> did believe and practiſe the Law of <hi>Retaliation,</hi> in an <hi>analogical</hi> ſenſe, at the times when theſe Debates were managed; I ſhall now ſubjoyn ſome Conſiderations for preferring the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> before that of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his followers: As, Firſt, The Queſtion was about the ſenſe of a political Law; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to have underſtood better than <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> becauſe he learn'd the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Law from <hi>Plato</hi> his Maſter, who wrote <hi>de legibus;</hi> and <hi>Menochius prooem. de Arbitrar. N.</hi> 3. calls him the learnedſt of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Diſciples. 2. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> being a Profeſſor of Philoſphy, and a conſtant Reſidenter at <hi>Athens,</hi> and having written well on the Politicks, its preſum'd he underſtood the Laws &amp; Cuſtoms of <hi>Athens,</hi> better than <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did who reſided long among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> with <hi>Amaſis</hi> their King. 3. Its probable that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> learn'd the firſt Principles of <hi>ſtrict Retaliation</hi> from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> where he alſo learn'd the fooliſh Opinions of the <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> or Tranſmigration of the Souls of Men into Beaſts and Plants, and the idolatrous Doctrine of worſhipping the Sun and Moon. 4. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſeems to have had little Authority among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> becauſe he was mocked by divers of them. <hi>Timon</hi> in his <hi>Silli</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches him for his Magical Arts, and hunting after the Praiſe of Men, without merit. <hi>Xenophanes Gratinus</hi> derides him in his <hi>Pythagorazuſa,</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> in his <hi>Tarentines,</hi> for his ridiculous Concluſions and ſcholaſtick Toys; and could there be a more ridiculous Fancy, than his adoring of Beans to that Degree of Superſtition, that he choos'd rather to be kill'd than make his eſcape, by trampling on them when purſu'd: more of his Follies may be found in his Life written by <hi>Diog. Laertius.</hi> 5. His abſurd Doctrine of Communication of Goods, needed <hi>ſtrict Retaliation</hi> to defend it againſt the Janglings which ſuch a Doctrine would produce; and his affecting the Name of a ſtrict Juſticiar, might be another cauſe to defend <hi>strict Retaliation.</hi> Laſtly, the learned <hi>Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Wallaeus, Matthaeus,</hi> and many other Divines and Lawyers, prefer the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and S. <hi>Caecilius,</hi> before theſe of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Phavorinus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's true indeed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="133"/> that <hi>Bodinus lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de repub. cap. ult.</hi> takes a way of his own, and cenſures both <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Phavorinus,</hi> as if they had miſtaken the meaning of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> and for this <hi>Bodinus</hi> himſelf is as ſeverely cenſured by <hi>Matthaeus dict. c.</hi> 4. <hi>N.</hi> 3. <hi>in fin.</hi> But, for all this, he acknowledges that <hi>ſtrict Retaliation</hi> was never practiſed in the Cities of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and cites <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> and the words of <hi>Rabbi Kana</hi> to prove it.</p>
                  <p>The only thing which ſeems to gravel <hi>Bodinus,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="134"/> (and which, as <hi>Matthaeus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, is neither cleared by <hi>Aristotle</hi> nor <hi>Phavorinus</hi>) is whether <hi>ſtrict Reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> was in uſe where the Offender and Offended were in equal Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as for example, a Peaſant demembring a Peaſant in a privat place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this is no difficulty, and <hi>Aristotles</hi> Arguments drawn from Circumſtances, are ſtill pungent againſt <hi>identical Retaliation,</hi> upon this ground, that if the Law had required it in caſes of equal Circumſtances, it would have diſtinguiſhed betwixt a ſimple and circumſtantiated Caſe, and would not have determined
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58259:29"/>the ſame Puniſhment in the general, which could be neither juſt nor poſſible in all caſes.</p>
                  <p>We cannot deny but ſome of the Oriental Nations,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="135"/> and particularly the <hi>Locrians</hi> did exact <hi>strict Retaliation</hi> for the <hi>Eye,</hi> and we have a remarkable Caſe in <hi>Diod. Siculus lib.</hi> 12, which happened to be pleaded upon the Law of <hi>Charondas. Si quis cui oculum eruerit, oculum reo pariter cruito.</hi> A <hi>Moncculus</hi> had his Eye ſmitten out, the <hi>Delinquent</hi> had one of his Eyes taken out by way of Recompenſe, but the <hi>Monoculus</hi> thinking that Puniſhment not ſufficient, brought the Caſe before the <hi>Aſſembly of the People,</hi> and demanded the other Eye alſo; the <hi>Delinquent</hi> alledged, that he had ſatisfied the Law by the loſs of one of his Eyes; the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> replyed that the <hi>Delinquent</hi> ought to be made blind ſince he had made him blind, and becauſe the Law did not ordain it, he crav'd the Law might be reſcinded, and another made more ſtrict: and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom of the Place, came with a Rope about his Neck ready to undergo the puniſhment of being hanged therewith, in caſe his Deſire ſhould be rejected, and ſo far prevail'd that the former Law was corrected. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is alſo given by <hi>Plato.</hi> But though all this be true, yet it proves not a general practice of <hi>strict Retaliation</hi> in all caſes; for, if that had been, then the Law would not have run <hi>ſingly</hi> as to the Eye, but in general Terms. Moreover, the Prohibition (which <hi>Aerodius</hi> mentions) holds forth, that the Law was made with a ſingular reſpect to the Eye, for its excellency and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the Body beyond other Members; and for this cauſe 'twas that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi> reckons the percuſſion of the Eye among atrocious Injuries §. 9. <hi>Inſt. de injur.</hi> and <hi>Charondas</hi> did no more than Chriſtians, who condemn <hi>strict Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation,</hi> have done: we have a proof in the words of St. <hi>Augustine Epist.</hi> 159. <hi>ad Marcellin.</hi> (cited by <hi>Gratian Cauſ.</hi> 23. <hi>q.</hi> 5. <hi>C. circumcelliones.</hi> 2.) where he relates that he himſelf interceded with <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> that the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,</hi> who were arraigned before him to be puniſh'd for whipping a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prieſt, and putting out one of his Eyes, and cutting off one of his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, might not be puniſh'd by <hi>ſtrict Retaliation:</hi> and thence it ſeems that <hi>ſtrict Retaliation,</hi> for ſuch atrocious Facts, was in uſe in his time. The ſame is prov'd by <hi>Novel:</hi> 92. of <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour: and by the Deciſion of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth againſt <hi>Zachora;</hi> cited N. 24. <hi>ſupra,</hi> and by <hi>Novel</hi> 142: of <hi>Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ordaining <hi>Castration</hi> to be puniſh'd with <hi>Caſtration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this may ſuffice for our ſecond Argument taken from comparing the Law of GOD, with the Laws and Writings of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Remans,</hi> on the Subject of <hi>ſtrict Retaliation;</hi> to prove the Concluſion formerly laid down, that although Retaliation in the general be founded on natural Equity, yet its ſtill to be underſtood as admitting of ſatisfaction by <hi>analogical</hi> and <hi>geometrical</hi> proportion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 3. To prove the ſame Concluſion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="136"/> ſhall be taken from the Authority of Divines and Lawyers.

We have Inſtances in the Collection of the Laws of the XII Tabb. made by <hi>Dionyſius Gothofredus,</hi> to prove that ſome of theſe Laws were not derogated from, but rather ſtrengthened by addition of new Actions; <hi>e. g. in Tit.</hi> 10. <hi>dict fragm.

                  <p>Further,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="148"/> it will appear by the following Accompt of time, that the Actions, <hi>ex Leg XII. Tabb, &amp; ex leg.

Caecilius:</hi> Now the Conference having been <hi>Anno Chr.</hi> 143. or thereby, as we ſhewed <hi>N.</hi> 144. <hi>ſupra;</hi> and the <hi>Lex Aquilia</hi> having had a Being in the time of <hi>Brutus</hi> (who cites &amp; decides a Caſe by it <hi>in l. ſi Servus</hi> 27. §. <hi>Si mulier ff. ad leg.

Gothofredus in fastis conſularibus</hi> aſſerts, (which in all probability was about the time he cited the <hi>Lex Aquilia,</hi> he having not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten till he was of Age;) it follows that the <hi>Lex Aquilia</hi> had endur'd (from the time of this <hi>Conſulſhip</hi> to the time of the foreſaid Conference) 274 years; ſuppoſing the Conference was <hi>A. Ch.</hi> 143. when <hi>A. Gellius</hi> wrote it. 'Twill then follow, that during all theſe 274 years, the Action which aroſe <hi>ex leg. XII Tabb. Si membrum rupſit,</hi> endur'd with the <hi>Actio utilis</hi> introduc'd by the <hi>Lex Aquilia.</hi> Another Accompt may be made from the time of <hi>Q.

Aquil.</hi> Now to find out the time wherein <hi>Q. Mutius</hi> liv'd, we muſt conſider that <hi>G. Aquilius</hi> was his ordinary Hearer; for ſo ſays <hi>Pomponius, dict. l.</hi> 2. §. §. 41.42. and the time of <hi>G. Aquilius</hi> muſt be found out by his conjunction with <hi>Cicero,</hi> who <hi>in topicis</hi> calls him his Familiar and Intimat: now <hi>Cicero</hi> (according to <hi>Dion.

And hereby it's evident, that the Law of the XII. <hi>Tabb. Si membrum rupſit;</hi> was none of theſe Laws which was derogated from by the <hi>Lex Aquilia;</hi> but rather is to be excepted from the general words
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58259:32"/>of <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> is fully anſwered.</p>
                  <p>This Calculation which I have inſiſted on, is not obvious to every perſon,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="149"/> and may be diverting; withal it may furniſh Conjecture that <hi>M.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 651. which doth not alter the caſe of his being Author of the Law; becauſe he might have been <hi>Tribunus Plebis,</hi> before the time that <hi>Jo.

                  <p>Before I enter upon <hi>Arbitrary Puniſhment,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="150"/> (which is the true Puniſhment of <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration</hi>) I ſhall according to the Method I propos'd, ſpeak a little to the Queſtion, how far theſe Crimes may be puniſhed with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Hand which gives the ſtroke? And this falls naturally in here; becauſe if the <hi>Demembration</hi> committed be of an Hand, then the Puniſhment will be <hi>Retaliation</hi> upon the Matter, though not of Deſign.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe it will be granted, that,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="151"/> albeit we allow not of cutting off the Hand by way of <hi>Retaliation,</hi> yet, its in the power of the Law-giver to make a Law for puniſhing certain Crimes, by cutting off the Hand of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent;</hi> There are many inſtances in the civil Law, as <hi>in l.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Auth. ſeq. c. de ſerv. fugit.</hi> A Slave deſerting and running over to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> is puniſhed in that manner. [where you may obſerve that the Amputation of the Foot (which was the delinquent Member) contained <hi>in dict. l.</hi> 3. is changed by the Authentick into the cutting off of the Hand] as alſo in <hi>Novel.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. the puniſhment of <hi>Amputation</hi> of the Hand, is appointed for the Exacters of Tribute, who expreſs not in their Books, the Quantities receiv'd; the ſame was the puniſhment of Writers of Heretical Books, <hi>Novel.</hi> 42. <hi>c.</hi> 1. §. 2. <hi>in fin.</hi> and of the Writers of falſe Inſtruments, <hi>Gloſs in dict.

Theſe two laſt were the proper Crimes of the Hand, which made the puniſhment the more agreeable: But withal it deſerves our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that this puniſhment was to be inflicted with much tenderneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Conſideration; and never to have place againſt both hands, <hi>dict.

                  <p>The like Puniſhment is among the later Laws of <hi>Saxony</hi> and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="152"/>

                  <p>The Argument of the Gloſs may be form'd in this manner:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="154"/> If <hi>Amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hand</hi> be inflicted for ſingle <hi>Vulneration,</hi> then much more, for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membration,</hi> but the firſt holds good and therefore the ſecond.

                     </q> and juſt ſo <hi>Demembration</hi> or <hi>Mutilation</hi> includes wounding; and therefore the puniſhment of ſingle wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may by conſequence be extended to be the puniſhment of <hi>Mutilation</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membration;</hi> But the Argument, as its form'd, will only conclude in the caſe where ſimple wounding, is puniſhable, <hi>poenâ amputationis manus,</hi> by <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi> Conſtitution; and that is only when the wounding is accompanied <hi>cum violatione pacis publicae;</hi> to which <hi>Gail,</hi> (treating of this and other Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that nature, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de pace publica, cap.</hi> 7.) <hi>&amp; Carpz. dict. qu.</hi> 40. <hi>N.</hi> 1.2. 3, 4. following him, require three Conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> 1.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="157"/> which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the place of <hi>Retaliation,</hi> as appears by the following Words of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi> §. 7. <hi>Inſt. de Injur. Poena autem injuriarum ex lege XII Tabularum propter Membrum quidem ruptum talio erat: propter os vero fractum nummariae poenae erant conſtitutae, quaſi in magna veterum paupertate. Sed poſtea Praetores permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebant ipſis, qui injuriam paſſi ſunt, eam aeſtimare: ut judex vel tanti [reum] condemnet, quanti injuriam paſſus aeſtimaverit, vel minoris, prout ei viſum fuerit. Sed Poena quidem injuriae quae ex lege XII Tabularum introducta eſt, in deſuetudinem abiit: quam autem Praetores introduxerunt (quae etiam honorariae appellaetur) in judiciis frequentatur: nam ſecundum gradum dignitatis, vitaeque honeſtatem, creſcit aut minuitur aeſtimatio injuriae, qui gradus condemnationis &amp; in ſervili perſona non immerito ſervatur: ut aliud in ſcrvo actore, aliud in medii actus homine, aliud in viliſſimo vel compedito jus aeſtimationis conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur.</hi> Which Text holds forth, that not only <hi>poena talionis propter membrum ruptum;</hi> but alſo the <hi>poenae nummariae</hi> 25 <hi>aſſium</hi> for common Injuries and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58259:34"/>thoſe other Mulcts <hi>pro oſſe fracto &amp; dentibus excuſſis,</hi> were gone in deſuetude: and there remain'd no other Branch of the Law of <hi>Retaliation</hi> contain'd in the XII Tables, except what related to the Puniſhment of falſe Witneſſes. The Text gives this Reaſon for aboliſhing the <hi>poenae nummariae,</hi> that they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted <hi>in maxima veterum paupertate;</hi> and though there be ſome Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who deny that the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſcarce of Money at the time; yet <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> proves it from <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 19. <hi>c.</hi> 3. and <hi>A.

Neracius</hi> had contemn'd; as is mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and in their ſtead to introduce Arbitrary Puniſhments. But the Text doth not condeſcend on the cauſe why <hi>Talio, propter membrum ruptum,</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, and <hi>Arbitrary Puniſhment</hi> introduc'd in place of it, which had been Arbitrary before; for the very Ranſom (whereof <hi>S. Caecilius</hi> makes mention in his Defence of that Law, in the Analogical ſenſe of it) was modified by the <hi>Praetor, arbitrarie;</hi> to make the <hi>Analogical</hi> proportion betwixt the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and the Delict; but that which I take to have been the Reaſon why the <hi>talio propter membrum ruptum</hi> is ſaid to have gone in deſuetude, as well as the <hi>poenae nummariae;</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary puniſhment</hi> to have come equally in the room of both, is that the words in the Law <hi>Talio Esto</hi> were often detorted, by the Party injur'd, to a <hi>Pythagorical</hi> ſenſe when he was malicious, or when the Quantity of the Ranſom did not pleaſe him. Wherefore it might be thought convenient in progreſs of time, to ſuffer that Law to go altogether in deſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and to give Redreſs to the Parties injur'd, by another Remedy; and probably it was by the <hi>actio utilis</hi> ariſing <hi>ex leg. Aquilia,</hi> which, having at firſt been introduc'd as an additional Remedy; and having for many years ſo continued without Derogation from theſe Laws of the <hi>Tables,</hi> might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after become the ſole Remedy, and ſo continue till the <hi>actio injuriarum</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
                  <p>We ſee now by the words of <hi>Tribonian,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="158"/> that the <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> of the XII <hi>Tabb.</hi> was in deſuetude, when the Inſtitutions were publiſhed, which was <hi>A.

                  <p>It being thus made appear that <hi>Arbitrary Puniſhment</hi> came in place of <hi>poena talionis;</hi> it follows that <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration,</hi>

                  <p>And yet for all this,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="178"/> it cannot be ſaid the Judge is more favourable than the Law, or that he contraveens the Law, or departs from it; but rather that he is <hi>Legis auxilium</hi> as we ſaid before, and a Preſerver of the Law, becauſe ſo the Law wills and diſpoſes, not only by many particular Texts, but alſo by that general Rule, <hi>Quod poena eſt commenſuranda delicto, de qua in l. ſancimus</hi> 22. <hi>C. de poenis.</hi> And <hi>Farin.</hi> from all this lays it down for a general Rule, <hi>N.</hi> 10. <hi>d. qu.</hi> that the Law has given the Judge a power, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diminiſh, or change Puniſhments, according to the Qualities or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Delinquency.

And 15. <hi>July</hi> 1672. <hi>Mowat</hi> and <hi>Neivings</hi> purſued by <hi>Cheyne</hi> of <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> and his Brother, for <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration,</hi> were decerned to pay a thouſand Pounds to the Purſuers, and a Fyne to the King; and to procure a Remiſſion, as the Privy Council had recommended; as may be ſeen in the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Regiſters, 29. <hi>July</hi> 1642. and 25. <hi>Auguſt</hi> following. But Damnages are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver decerned, unleſs the Party injur'd purſue for them; and all this is founded on an old Statute, <hi>Cap:</hi> 11: <hi>Stat:</hi> 2: <hi>Rob:</hi> 2. which likewiſe preſcribes a corporal Puniſhment, and the method of Purſuing; the words are <q>If any man mutilats another, or Wounds or Beats him by forethought Fellony, and the Party griev'd purſues him before a Judge by Suit or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, ſuch Form and Order of Proceſs ſhall be deduced and led againſt the Treſpaſſer, as is ordained againſt a Man-ſlayer, until he compear at a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory day, and then he ſhall paſs to the knowledge of an Aſſize; and if he be convict by the Aſſize, he ſhall Redeem his Life from the Judge or Major, and by the Conſideration of the Judge he ſhall ſatisfie the Party les'd; And if he be not purſu'd by the Party les'd, he ſhall be Indicted for that Deed, and thole an Aſſize, at the Juſtice Air, without delay or excuſe, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convict, ſhall Redeem his Liſe and Aſſyth the Party.</q> The Foundation of the Action for Damnages lies in theſe words, which appoint the Party les'd to be ſatisfy'd by the Conſideration of the Judge, when the Party les'd is Purſuer, and to be Aſſythed if the Delinquent be Indicted.</p>
                  <p>But the great Difficulty lyes in theſe words of the Statute,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="193"/> which ordains the Delinquent <hi>who mutilats or wounds another by forethought Fellony, to be purſued by the ſame manner of Proces as a Man-ſlayer is purſued,</hi> and if he be convict <hi>to redeem his Life:</hi> which leads me to the laſt Puniſhment of <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration</hi> I promiſed to ſpeak to, <hi>viz.</hi> If it be Capital? For the Words HE SHALL REDEEM HIS LIFE, imply, that the Judge if he find cauſe, may inflict Capital Puniſhment, if the Crime be committed <hi>by forethought Fellony,</hi> which is the caſe of the Statute. The Grounds of this Difficulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the words of the Statute, are 1. That <hi>Skeen,</hi> who in the Latine Copy of the old Statutes has writen learn'd Notes on them, paſſes this Statute without any Obſervation, which holds further that it appeared difficult to him, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that it plainly decreed that capital Puniſhment might be inflicted in the caſe of the Statute. 2. There are divers later Laws, <hi>viz. Act</hi> 28. <hi>Parl.</hi> 3. <hi>Ja.</hi> 4. <hi>Act</hi> 118. <hi>Parl.</hi> 7. <hi>Ja.</hi> 5. <hi>Act</hi> 76. <hi>Parl.</hi> 6. and <hi>Act</hi> 3. <hi>Parl.</hi> 21. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. which rank the Crimes of <hi>Mutilation</hi> and <hi>Demembration</hi> with <hi>Homicide</hi> and other
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58259:40"/>
                     <hi>Capital Crimes,</hi> and ordain them to be purſu'd by the ſame form and manner of Proceſs; which are the very words of King <hi>Roberts</hi> Statute. And none of theſe Statutes are reſcinded by any poſterior Law. 3. If Treſpaſſers were not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the pain of Death, but only to pecuniary Mulcts, they would not need Remiſſions, and yet by the above-cited Deciſions it appears, that the Judges after they had decerned Damages to the Party injur'd, and Fines to the King, they decerned them to procure Remiſſions, and the Plaintiffe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto, by granting a Letter of Slaines. Moreover, upon the 17. of <hi>May</hi> 1610. <hi>Keith,</hi> purſued by <hi>Lindſay</hi> for <hi>Demembration,</hi> produced a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which he had obtained before the Purſuit, burdening him to aſſyth the Party, which ſhews that an Aſſythment is not ſufficient to free the Party of further puniſhment. <hi>Lastly,</hi> There's a Letter from the King to the Privy Council recorded in the Journal Books, 14. <hi>Sept.</hi> 1608. recommending that <hi>Henderſon</hi> for demembrating <hi>Montgomery</hi> of three Fingers of his left Hand might be baniſhed, becauſe it was not uſual in this Nation to inflict the pain of Death for the Crime of <hi>Demembration.</hi> Theſe words do imply that there was a Law for that Puniſhment, but it was gone in Deſuetude: And theſe grounds of Doubt are conſiderable. But to me it ſeems that the Statute of King <hi>Robert</hi> was made only <hi>ad terrorem</hi> and to force a Ranſome from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, becauſe it runs not in the Stile of a <hi>peremptory and poſitive Statute,</hi> but in words importing that the Life was in the Kings Will, and was to be redeemed by a Ranſome at the Diſcretion of the Judge, and ſo it comes to the Senſe which S. <hi>Caecilius</hi> in his Conference with <hi>Phavorinus</hi> puts on the Law of <hi>Retaliation</hi> in the XII Tables; And it would have been very hard, after all Nations have rejected <hi>ſtrict Retaliation</hi> to have puniſhed <hi>Demembration</hi> with Death, unleſs the Crime were accompanied with ſuch atrocious Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as might juſtly augment the puniſhment. We read in <hi>Strabo lib.</hi> 15. that ſome <hi>Indians</hi> did both inflict <hi>Retaliation</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> but <hi>Grotius dejure B. &amp;. P. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap</hi> 20. proves by many Teſtimonies that Chriſtians, though they may juſtly demand Puniſhment, yet ſhould incline to the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part. And the Law gives it for a Rule <hi>in paenalibus. l. factum.</hi> 155. §. 2. <hi>ff. de Reg. jur.</hi> unleſs the Crime be very atrocious, and then Severity is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. <hi>l. perſpiciendum</hi> 11. <hi>in prin. ff. de paenis.</hi>
